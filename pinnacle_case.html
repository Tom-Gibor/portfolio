            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
                The East Asian market has different offers of mobile wallet applications than commonly used in the West.
                Many of these apps require users to have a local bank account or a certain type of visa.

            <h2>Challanges</h2>
            <p>The first challenge is to ensure that the benefits of using the app outweigh any inconvenience or potential risks.
                 Many users have had negative experiences with these types of apps, losing money and feeling powerless to recover it. 
                 Our primary challenge is to earn the trust of our users.</p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>I undertook this project from a group of entrepreneurs residing in Vietnam.
                I'm acquainted with one of them and he shared the problem they would wish to resolve. 
                My role involved conducting UX research and following the design methodology to create
                 a fully functioning prototype suitable for programming and user testing.</p>

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>First, it's important to note that the design process is <b>far from a linear path</b>, 
                often taking <b>unexpected turns</b> <b>and requiring multiple iterations.</b> 
                For instance, I found myself needing to re-prototype and test several times as <b>new insights</b> emerged from these tests.
                On top of that, after implementing all the improvements necessary,
                 I saw the need to <b>again empathize</b> with our users and <b>reassess</b> our solution.
                I'll explain these in detail later on.</p>
            <br><br><br>
            <img src="img/desgin_process_x4.png" alt="the stages of the process design" width="45%">
            <br><br><br>
            <p>During the first execution of the design process I <b>defined the problem</b> our product addresses,
                 I <b>set goals</b>, and anticipated challenges. After analyzing competitors,
                  I focused on <b>understanding</b> potential <b>users</b> and their motivations.
                   Next, I generated initial ideas and solutions for testing. Before creating a final product,
                    I <b>iterated</b> through simpler prototypes to identify and address potential issues.
                     Once I had a complete prototype, I conducted <b>testing</b> with colleagues and potential users,
                      incorporating feedback to improve the design and plan for further refinement.</p>

        <div><!--Competitive Analysis_Intro-->
            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>Competitor analysis is crucial for the UX design for a few important reasons.
                 Firstly, it helps spot what <b>competitors do well</b> and where they <b>fall short</b>,
                  so that we can <b>improve</b> on that. Secondly, it helps figure out <b>where we fit</b> in the market,
                   making it easier to differentiate ourselves effectively and creating our unique brand <b>identity</b>.
                    Crucially, it gives <b>insights</b> into what <b>customers want</b>, making it easier to meet their <b>needs</b>. </p>

        <div><!--User Research-->
            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>WHAT: Before conducting user <b>interviews</b> I launched an <b>unpaid survey</b> that gathered 15 responses and,
                 although being a small number, it allowed me to approach user interviews with clues regarding <b>user habits</b>.
                  I then interviewed potential clients using 10-12 open-ended questions.

                WHO: We identified 2 distinct audience groups. First are people who either use or download an e-wallet application,
                 aged (28-42) who travel as a couple, often with kids. Second are somewhat technologically inexperienced yet open-minded older people,
                  aged (43-70) and usually travel with kids, other couples, or part of a group. 
                
                WHY: By combining both <b>quantitative</b> (survey) and <b></b>qualitative</b> (interviews)  methods,
                 I was able to gather a comprehensive <b>understanding</b> of user <b>behaviors</b> and <b>preferences</b> related to e-wallet usage.
                  This approach sets a strong foundation for <b>informed decision-making</b> and product development.</p>

                <h2>User Flows</h2>
                <p>User flows are an important design technic that helped me detail the steps taken by a user leaving from point A,
                    aiming to arrive at a certain point B using the product.
                    Here I sketched two diagrams outlining the user pathway to complete a payment, and to validate a ride ticket.
                    It proved to be an invaluable tool for identifying the necessary screens and interactions of the app before starting
                        the information architecture phase.</p>

            <h2>Card Sorting</h2>
            <p>The Information Architecture phase requires any designer or product manager to take crucial decision concerning the structure of our solutions. To avoid guessing, I used the Card Sorting method, tasking participants with grouping 20 different concepts. This tool allowed me to give users a more seamless experience of navigation through the app.
                The higher the number, the higher percentage of time the items were grouped together by users.</p>

            <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
            <p>After sorting the cards, I worked on organizing and mapping out the hierarchy.
                 I drew a sitemap to show how the pages are arranged and linked together in the app.
                  This stage helps us to think of all the user flows and interactions we need to design,
                   and so sets the stage for the first design iteration.</p>

            <h2>Low Fidelity Prototyping</h2>
            <p>After sketching a comprehensive site map, and several user flows, it was time to make the plans a reality.
                 Although an exciting stage for every designer,
                  it was important to not fall into the trap of wasting precious time on aesthetics,
                   as this phase is more about designing the interactions rather than the app style.
                    Here are a few low-fi prototypes that include possible pathways for users.</p>

                  I used Figma to create basic wireframes, mid-fidelity,
                   and finally, working and interactive prototypes.
                    These prototypes were then used to conduct Usability Testing, as detailed below.</p>

                <p>Usability testing is a design practice in which we let real users use a prototype and by which we reveal
                    confirm or refute certain hypothesis we had regarding the design.
                    It is practice that has a great return for the resources invested. </p>

                                app. Notably by observing human errors. I tried to find new ways the
                                app could be more efficient and learnable for the users.</p>

            This was the first project I undertook entirely by myself.
             From the problem statement to research, iteration, design,
              and revisions. It is ready, but like every project it can surely be improved on.
               I learned a lot about the struggle of extracting useful information from sources online and from people.
                One mistake I made at the beginning was placing buttons without texts, which can often create confusion.
                 I also left out coaching marks that could ease users' learning curve. 
                Another conclusion I had from the user research is that it might not be enough to create a comfortable environment and ask “good” questions.
                 People don't know what they don't know, and sometimes they can't tell us the best answers because they are unaware of them.
                  For my future user research, I will search for more strategies to find useful information about users' perceptions and behaviors.
                The next challenge I'm taking on myself is building the web application by myself using front-end developer's skills.
