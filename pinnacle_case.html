            <p>
                The East Asian market has different offers of mobile wallet applications than commonly used in the West.
                Many of these apps require users to have a local bank account or a certain type of visa.

            <h2>Challanges</h2>
            <p>The first challenge is to ensure that the benefits of using the app outweigh any inconvenience or potential risks.
                 Many users have had negative experiences with these types of apps, losing money and feeling powerless to recover it. 
                 Our primary challenge is to earn the trust of our users.</p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>I undertook this project from a group of entrepreneurs residing in Vietnam.
                I'm acquainted with one of them and he shared the problem they would wish to resolve. 
                My role involved conducting UX research and following the design methodology to create
                 a fully functioning prototype suitable for programming and user testing.</p>

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>First, it's important to note that the design process is <b>far from a linear path</b>, 
                often taking <b>unexpected turns</b> <b>and requiring multiple iterations.</b> 
                For instance, I found myself needing to re-prototype and test several times as <b>new insights</b> emerged from these tests.
                On top of that, after implementing all the improvements necessary,
                 I saw the need to <b>again empathize</b> with our users and <b>reassess</b> our solution.
                I'll explain these in detail later on.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/desgin_process_x4.png" alt="the stages of the process design" width="40%">
            <br>
            <p>During the first execution of the design process I <b>defined the problem</b> our product addresses,
                 I <b>set goals</b>, and anticipated challenges. After analyzing competitors,
                  I focused on <b>understanding</b> potential <b>users</b> and their motivations.
                   Next, I generated initial ideas and solutions for testing. Before creating a final product,
                    I <b>iterated</b> through simpler prototypes to identify and address potential issues.
                     Once I had a complete prototype, I conducted <b>testing</b> with colleagues and potential users,
                      incorporating feedback to improve the design and plan for further refinement.</p>

        <div><!--Competitive Analysis_Intro-->
            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>Competitor analysis is crucial for the UX design for a few important reasons.
                 Firstly, it helps spot what <b>competitors do well</b> and where they <b>fall short</b>,
                  so that we can <b>improve</b> on that. Secondly, it helps figure out <b>where we fit</b> in the market,
                   making it easier to differentiate ourselves effectively and creating our unique brand <b>identity</b>.
                    Crucially, it gives <b>insights</b> into what <b>customers want</b>, making it easier to meet their <b>needs</b>. </p>

                        continuously expanding its services and user base.

                    <p>By researching Google wallet  I could learn more about a Western- American consumer oriented product,

        <div><!--User Research-->
            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>WHAT: Before conducting user <b>interviews</b> I launched an <b>unpaid survey</b> that gathered 15 responses and,
                 although being a small number, it allowed me to approach user interviews with clues regarding <b>user habits</b>.
                  I then interviewed potential clients using 10-12 open-ended questions.

                WHO: We identified 2 distinct audience groups. First are people who either use or download an e-wallet application,
                 aged (28-42) who travel as a couple, often with kids. Second are somewhat technologically inexperienced yet open-minded older people,
                  aged (43-70) and usually travel with kids, other couples, or part of a group. 
                
                WHY: By combining both <b>quantitative</b> (survey) and <b></b>qualitative</b> (interviews)  methods,
                 I was able to gather a comprehensive <b>understanding</b> of user <b>behaviors</b> and <b>preferences</b> related to e-wallet usage.
                  This approach sets a strong foundation for <b>informed decision-making</b> and product development.</p>
